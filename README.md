# Description

This application is designed to display the current weather and the forecast for the next five days for various cities around the globe.

When the user loads the page, they are presented with a search bar and buttons representing cities that the user searched on the last browswer session. The user will then search for a city using that search bar. When the user clicks the search button, then the current weather information and the forecast for the next five days for that city shows on the screen.

There are several enhancements that could be made to this application. First, if a user searches a city that appears in multiple places, then the user could be presented with a dropdown menu to select which they would like to use. For example, there is a Jacksonville in Florida and in Alabama. Currently, the program would default to the first city shown in the API. Secondly, the search history could be updated to prevent repeat cities or even better provide a counter to show when a user has searched a city multiple times.
